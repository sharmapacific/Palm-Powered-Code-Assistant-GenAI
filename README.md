# **Advanced Python Code Analysis and Enhancement Tool**

## **Overview**

The Advanced Python Code Analysis and Enhancement Tool is a web-based application designed to analyze and improve code snippets. The tool provides functionalities such as detailed code explanations, refactoring suggestions, automated unit test case generation, and code quality metrics. Built using Python and Gradio, this application leverages advanced AI models to deliver intelligent insights and recommendations for code enhancement.

## **Features**

- **Code Explanation**: Provides step-by-step breakdowns of code execution to help users understand how their code works.
- **Refactoring Suggestions**: Offers actionable recommendations to improve code readability, performance, and maintainability.
- **Unit Test Case Generation**: Automatically generates unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Displays comprehensive metrics including cyclomatic complexity, number of lines, and AST nodes to assess code quality.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core language for backend logic and functionalities.
- **Gradio**: Framework for building the interactive web interface.
- **Generative AI**: Models used for code explanation, refactoring, and unit test generation.
- **Code Quality Tools**: Libraries for analyzing and displaying code metrics.
